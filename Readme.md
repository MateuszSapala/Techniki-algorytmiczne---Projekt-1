# About the project
The program is designed to store real numbers of arbitrarily long.

Digits are stored in it in the form of linear lists (integers and fractional digits), in which each element stores a single digit and a reference to the next. The first element of an integer list is 1 for a positive number or -1 for a negative number.

## The numbers can be:
- entered
- written out
- added
- subtracted
- multiplied
- divided (along with the rest of the division).
